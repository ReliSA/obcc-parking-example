This is a set of OSGi bundles to demonstrate various scenarios in bundle
substitutability and versioning. The implementation uses OSGi core services
in its plain, low level form (no ServiceTracker and other goodies), 
relying on framework to repeatedy attempt to re-start a bundle if activator
start() fails with an exception due to unfulfilled service dependencies.
