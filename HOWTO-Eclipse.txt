To set up the projects for app revisions correctly in Eclipse, it is needed to
import the projects as plain Java projects and then

* set source folders to the "src/" subfolder
* add JARs of org.osgi.core 4.2 , slf4j api to classpath (as external JARs or user libraries) -- they are in the "lib/" folder of the "cnf" project, as a kind of hack since the cnf project (a bndtools configuration) does not use the lib/ folder
* add to classpath as JARs (not "external JARs") the missing bundles, taking them from 
  the "generated/" folders of preceding app revisions -- see the table in PDF in doc/ folder 
  to get the reference list of which bundle from which app revision project to add where
* make sure that the JDK library is in project's classpath (sometimes the import left it out)
* to test the bundles if bndtools is not able to launch the framework: if it at least generates their JARs, take a Felix installation, copy all the files from the "cnf" project "lib/" folder plus the generated bundles into the Felix "bundle/" folder, start the framework; if some bundles do not start because "some service unavailable, exiting", then just start the given bundles again manually
