To set up the projects for app revisions correctly in Eclipse, it is needed to
import the projects as plain Java projects and then

* set source folders to the "src/" subfolder
* add JARs of org.osgi.core 4.2 , slf4j api to classpath (as external JARs or user libraries)
* add to classpath as JARs (not "external JARs") the missing bundles, taking them from 
  the "generated/" folders of preceding app revisions 
* make sure that the JDK library is in project's classpath (sometimes the import left it out)
